sud is a daemon to execute interactive and non-interactive processes with 
special (and customizable) permissions

this program gives the following advantages:
- you can switch to root privileges on a remote machine and keep its disks 
  mounted with nosuid flag
- you don't have permission to read the socket unless you're in the authgroup 
- user identification will be authenticated via unix socket
- you can drop privileges and use sud to implement a suid program in a nosuid 
  environment
- you can log access for a particular program or file, even if it wasn't
  created with logging facilities

  typical permissions for a suipfile are: 	
	-r-x------  1 root  bin  12288 Aug  5 12:25 /usr/sbin/ilogin
