sud (superuser daemon) permits a user to switch to root privileges 
and to use a suid program in a nosuid environment. It is based on a 
client/server model and on the ability to pass file descriptors 
between processes. sud permits you to choose your authentication method, 
and your effective credentials will be checked by using a Unix domain socket.
